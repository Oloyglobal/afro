          Learn more Breast augmentation, also known as augmentation
          mammoplasty, is a cosmetic surgery procedure that uses breast implants
          or fat transfer to increase breast size and change their shape. Here's
          a more detailed explanation: What it is: Purpose: Breast augmentation
          aims to enlarge the breasts, improve their shape, and restore volume
          lost after weight loss or pregnancy. Procedure: It involves placing
          breast implants (filled with saline or silicone gel) under the breast
          tissue or chest muscles. Types of Implants: Saline Implants: Filled
          with sterile saltwater. Silicone Implants: Filled with a body-safe
          silicone gel. Placement: Implants can be placed behind the breast
          tissue (subglandular) or behind the chest muscle (submuscular).
          Incision Locations: The surgeon can make incisions in the crease under
          the breast (inframammary), under the arm (transaxillary), or around
          the nipple (periareolar). Why people choose it: Cosmetic Reasons: To
          increase breast size, improve shape, or enhance overall appearance.
          Reconstructive Reasons: To restore breast volume after breast surgery,
          weight loss, or pregnancy. Things to consider: Risks and
          Complications: As with any surgery, breast augmentation carries
          potential risks, including infection, bleeding, and implant
          complications. Durability: Breast implants are not permanent and may
          need to be replaced after 10-15 years. Recovery: Recovery time varies
          depending on the type of procedure and individual factors, but it
          typically involves pain, swelling, and bruising. Cost: The cost of
          breast augmentation can vary depending on the surgeon, location, and
          type of implants used. Consultation: It's crucial to consult with a
          qualified and board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss your goals,
          risks, and options. Breast augmentation - Mayo Clinic 10 Sept 2024 â€”
